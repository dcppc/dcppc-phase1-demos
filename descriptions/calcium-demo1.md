# Calcium Demo 1 - Searching: Web Interface to search subsets of curated phenotypic/clinical data

This demo is tracked with this ticket: https://github.com/dcppc/dcppc-deliverables/issues/1

Team Calcium has created a short video to demonstrate a simple web interface to search subsets of curated phenotypic/clinical data for selected studies from TOPMed and GTex. The video demonstrates how we use a data model to organize metadata in a graphical format from different studies to facilitate cross-project analysis. We also present a GraphQL interface to run rich queries to search for and filter data using different phenotypic and clinical data variables and run analysis using Jupyter notebook.
